Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the constructors for all three classes. I decided to overload the constructors for each class because it would let objects be made even if not all the infomation is known. This leads to more flexibility with object creation.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was creating the buildings in Campus map, as it was easy to create the objects. What didn't was trying to overload the methods, but then I understood how to overload the methods. Advice would be to understand the difference between overloads and overrides.
